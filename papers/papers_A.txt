Title: Tropical Cirrus in Global‐Storm Resolving Models: 3. Seasonal Changes and TTL Cirrus in the Tropical Western Pacific Using DYAMOND
Year: 2025
Abstract: Recent advances in computer modeling have spurred the production of several global storm‐resolving models (GSRMs), which explicitly represent atmospheric circulations from convective to global scales. As a result, GSRMs simulate the formation and evolution of tropical cirrus clouds more physically than typical global climate models/general circulation models (GCMs) which use parameterizations to represent deep convection. We analyze the output from nine GSRMs from the DYAMOND initiative, focusing on the second phase of DYAMOND that simulated a period in January–February 2020. This paper is the third in a series investigating tropical cirrus clouds in GSRMs using DYAMOND model output for an intercomparison. In the tropics, models capture the mean outgoing longwave radiation within −5 to 14 W m−2 of observed climatology, though most models have more convective precipitation over the 40‐day simulation period than observed. While the models represent large‐scale tropical convection with some fidelity, large regional differences in cloud properties and top‐of‐atmosphere radiation fluxes exist. We focus on a region within the Tropical Western Pacific to study the small‐scale features available with the high spatiotemporal resolution of GSRMs. Most models that participated in both phases of DYAMOND capture the seasonal differences between the two phases, yet each model exhibits unique cloud populations that are persistent across seasons. GSRMs even simulate the notoriously difficult‐to‐observe tropical tropopause layer (TTL) cirrus, providing a novel perspective on TTL cirrus even though the models have different cloud characteristics over the short 40‐days simulation.

Title: Internal Ocean‐Atmosphere Variability in Kilometer‐Scale Radiative‐Convective Equilibrium
Year: 2025
Abstract: We describe internal, low‐frequency variability in a 21‐year simulation with a cloud‐resolving model. The model domain is the length of the equatorial Pacific and includes a slab ocean, which permits coherent cycles of sea surface temperature (SST), atmospheric convection, and the convectively coupled circulation. The warming phase of the cycle is associated with near‐uniform SST, less organized convection, and sparse low cloud cover, while the cooling phase exhibits strong SST gradients, highly organized convection, and enhanced low cloudiness. Both phases are quasi‐stable but, on long timescales, are ultimately susceptible to instabilities resulting in rapid phase transitions. The internal cycle is leveraged to understand the factors controlling the strength and structure of the tropical overturning circulation and the stratification of the tropical troposphere. The overturning circulation is strongly modulated by convective organization, with SST playing a lesser role. When convection is highly organized, the circulation is weaker and more bottom‐heavy. Alternatively, tropospheric stratification depends on both convective organization and SST, depending on the vertical level. SST‐driven variability dominates aloft while organization‐driven variability dominates at lower levels. A similar pattern is found in ERA5 reanalysis of the equatorial Pacific. The relationship between convective organization and stratification is explicated using a simple entraining plume model. The results highlight the importance of convective organization for tropical variability and lay a foundation for future work using coupled, idealized models that explicitly resolve convection.

Title: Resolving Low Cloud Feedbacks Globally With E3SM High‐Res MMF: Agreement With LES but Stronger Shortwave Effects
Year: 2025
Abstract: This study investigates low cloud feedback in a warmer climate using global simulations from the High‐Resolution Multi‐scale Modeling Framework (HR‐MMF), which explicitly simulates small‐scale eddies globally. Two 5‐year simulations—one with present‐day sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a second with SSTs warmed uniformly by 4 K—reveal a positive global shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE = 0.3 W/ m2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ /K), comparable to estimates from CMIP models. As the climate warms, significant reductions in low cloud cover occur over stratocumulus regions. This study is the first attempt to compare HR‐MMF results with predictions from idealized large‐eddy simulations from the CGILS intercomparison. Despite different underlying assumptions, we find qualitative agreement in SWCRE and inversion height changes between HR‐MMF and CGILS predictions. This suggests reasonable credibility for the CGILS framework in predicting cloud responses under the out‐of‐sample conditions found in HR‐MMF. However, the HR‐MMF exhibits stronger SWCRE changes than predicted by CGILS. We explore potential causes for this discrepancy, examining variations in cloud‐controlling factors (CCFs) and cloud conditions. Our results show a fairly homogeneous SWCRE response, with little systematic variation tied to the variations in CCFs. This reveals a dominant role for SST forcing in modulating SWCRE.

Title: Sensitivities of Large Eddy Simulations of Aerosol Plume Transport and Cloud Response
Year: 2025
Abstract: Cloud responses to surface‐based sources of aerosol perturbation partially depend on how turbulent transport of the aerosol to cloud base affects the spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol. Here, scenarios of plume injection below a marine stratocumulus cloud are modeled using large eddy simulations coupled to a prognostic bulk aerosol and cloud microphysics scheme. Both passive plumes, consisting of an inert tracer, and active plumes are investigated, where the latter are representative of saltwater droplet plumes such as have been proposed for marine cloud brightening. Passive plume scenarios show higher in‐plume cloud brightness (relative to out‐of‐plume) due to the predominant transport of the passive plume tracer from the near‐surface to the cloud layer within updrafts. These updrafts rise into brighter areas within the cloud deck, even in the absence of an aerosol perturbation associated with an active plume. Comparing albedo at in‐plume to out‐of‐plume locations associates the inert plume with the brightest cloud locations, without any causal effect of the plume on the cloud. Numerical sensitivities are first assessed to establish a suitable model configuration. Then sensitivity to particle injection rate is investigated. Trade‐offs are identified between the number of injected particles and the suppressive effect of droplet evaporation on plume loft and spread. Furthermore, as the near‐field in‐plume brightening effect does not depend significantly on injection rate given a suitable definition of perturbed versus unperturbed regions of the flow, plume area is a key controlling factor on the overall cloud brightening effect of an aerosol perturbation.

Title: What Sets the Tropical Cold Point in GSRMs During Boreal Winter? Overshooting Convection Versus Cirrus Lofting
Year: 2025
Abstract: The cold point tropopause, the minimum temperature within the tropical upper troposphere‐lower stratosphere region (UTLS), significantly impacts Earth's climate by influencing the amount of water vapor entering the lower stratosphere. Understanding which mechanisms are most important in setting the cold point temperature and height may help us better predict how it will change in a future warmed climate. In this analysis we evaluate two mechanisms that may influence the cold point—cold point‐overshooting convection and the radiative lofting of thin cirrus near the cold point—during boreal winter by comparing 30‐day global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations from the winter phase of the DYAMOND initiative to satellite observations. GSRMs have explicit deep convection and sufficiently fine grid spacings to simulate convective overshoots and UTLS cirrus, making them promising tools for this purpose. We find that the GSRMs reproduce the observed distribution of cold point‐overshooting convection but do not simulate enough cirrus capable of radiative lofting near the cold point. Both the models and observations show a strong relationship between areas of frequent cold point overshoots and colder cold points, suggesting that cold point‐overshooting convection has a notable influence on the mean cold point. However, we find little evidence that the radiative lofting of cold point cirrus substantially influences the cold point. Cold point‐overshooting convection alone cannot explain all variations in the cold point across different GSRMs or regions; future studies using longer GSRM simulations that consider longer‐term UTLS processes are needed to fully understand what sets the cold point.

Title: A Simple Model for the Evaporation of Hydrometeors and Their Isotopes
Year: 2024
Abstract: Cloud condensation and hydrometeor evaporation fractionate stable isotopes of water, enriching liquid with heavy isotopes; whereupon updrafts, downdrafts, and rain vertically redistribute water and its isotopes in the lower troposphere. These vertical water fluxes through the marine boundary layer affect low cloud climate feedback and, combined with isotope fractionation, are hypothesized to explain the depletion of tropical precipitation at higher precipitation rates known as the “amount effect.” Here, an efficient and numerically stable quasi‐analytical model simulates the evaporation of raindrops and enrichment of their isotope composition. It is applied to a drop size distribution and subcloud environment representative of Atlantic trade cumulus clouds. Idealized physics experiments artificially zero out selected processes to discern the separate effects on the isotope ratio of raindrops, of exchange with the environment, evaporation, and kinetic molecular diffusion. A parameterization of size‐dependent molecular and eddy diffusion is formulated that enriches raindrops much more strongly (+5‰ for deuterated water [HDO] and +3.5‰ for H218 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}^{18}$ O) than equilibrium evaporation as they become smaller than 1 mm. The effect on evaporated vapor is also assessed. Rain evaporation enriches subcloud vapor by +12‰ per mm rain (for HDO), explaining observations of enriched vapor in cold pools sourced by evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Drops smaller than 0.5 mm evaporate completely before falling 700 m in typical subtropical marine boundary layer conditions. The early and complete evaporation of these smaller drops in the rain size distribution enriches the vapor produced by rain evaporation.

Title: Exploring ship track spreading rates with a physics-informed Langevin particle parameterization
Year: 2024
Abstract: Abstract. The rate at which aerosols spread from a point source injection, such as from a ship or other stationary pollution source, is critical for accurately representing subgrid plume spreading in a climate model. Such climate model results will guide future decisions regarding the feasibility and application of large-scale intentional marine cloud brightening (MCB). Prior modeling studies have shown that the rate at which ship plumes spread may be strongly dependent on meteorological conditions, such as precipitating versus non-precipitating boundary layers and shear. In this study, we apply a Lagrangian particle model (PM-ABL v1.0), governed by a Langevin stochastic differential equation, to create a simplified framework for predicting the rate of spreading from a ship-injected aerosol plume in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating boundary layers. The velocity and position of each stochastic particle is predicted with the acceleration of each particle being driven by the turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate, momentum variance, and mean wind. These inputs to the stochastic particle velocity equation are derived from high-fidelity large-eddy simulations (LES) equipped with a prognostic aerosol–cloud microphysics scheme (UW-SAM) to simulate an aerosol injection from a ship into a cloud-topped marine boundary layer. The resulting spreading rate from the reduced-order stochastic model is then compared to the spreading rate in the LES. The stochastic particle velocity representation is shown to reasonably reproduce spreading rates in sheared, precipitating, and non-precipitating cases using domain-averaged turbulent statistics from the LES.


Title: Physical science research needed to evaluate the viability and risks of marine cloud brightening
Year: 2024
Abstract: Marine cloud brightening (MCB) is the deliberate injection of aerosol particles into shallow marine clouds to increase their reflection of solar radiation and reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the climate system. From the physical science perspective, the consensus of a broad international group of scientists is that the viability of MCB will ultimately depend on whether observations and models can robustly assess the scale-up of local-to-global brightening in today’s climate and identify strategies that will ensure an equitable geographical distribution of the benefits and risks associated with projected regional changes in temperature and precipitation. To address the physical science knowledge gaps required to assess the societal implications of MCB, we propose a substantial and targeted program of research—field and laboratory experiments, monitoring, and numerical modeling across a range of scales.

Title: Aitken Mode Aerosols Buffer Decoupled Mid‐Latitude Boundary Layer Clouds Against Precipitation Depletion
Year: 2024
Abstract: Aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions are a leading source of uncertainty in estimating climate sensitivity. Remote marine boundary layers where accumulation mode (∼100–400 nm diameter) aerosol concentrations are relatively low are very susceptible to aerosol changes. These regions also experience heightened Aitken mode aerosol (∼10–100 nm) concentrations associated with ocean biology. Aitken aerosols may significantly influence cloud properties and evolution by replenishing cloud condensation nuclei and droplet number lost through precipitation (i.e., Aitken buffering). We use a large‐eddy simulation with an Aitken‐mode enabled microphysics scheme to examine the role of Aitken buffering in a mid‐latitude decoupled boundary layer cloud regime observed on 15 July 2017 during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic flight campaign: cumulus rising into stratocumulus under elevated Aitken concentrations (∼100–200 mg−1). In situ measurements are used to constrain and evaluate this case study. Our simulation accurately captures observed aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions and reveals time‐evolving processes driving regime development and evolution. Aitken activation into the accumulation mode in the cumulus layer provides a reservoir for turbulence and convection to carry accumulation aerosols into the drizzling stratocumulus layer above. Further Aitken activation occurs aloft in the stratocumulus layer. Together, these activation events buffer this cloud regime against precipitation removal, reducing cloud break‐up and associated increases in heterogeneity. We examine cloud evolution sensitivity to initial aerosol conditions. With halved accumulation number, Aitken aerosols restore accumulation concentrations, maintain droplet number similar to original values, and prevent cloud break‐up. Without Aitken aerosols, precipitation‐driven cloud break‐up occurs rapidly. In this regime, Aitken buffering sustains brighter, more homogeneous clouds for longer.

Title: Tropical Cirrus Are Highly Sensitive to Ice Microphysics Within a Nudged Global Storm‐Resolving Model
Year: 2024
Abstract: Cirrus dominate the longwave radiative budget of the tropics. For the first time, the variability in cirrus properties and longwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) that arises from using different microphysical schemes within nudged global storm‐resolving simulations from a single model, is quantified. Nudging allows us to compute radiative biases precisely using coincident satellite measurements and to fix the large‐scale dynamics across our set of simulations to isolate the influence of microphysics. We run 5‐day simulations with four commonly‐used microphysics schemes of varying complexity (SAM1MOM, Thompson, M2005 and P3) and find that the tropical average longwave CRE varies over 20 W m−2 between schemes. P3 best reproduces observed longwave CRE. M2005 and P3 simulate cirrus with realistic frozen water path but unrealistically high ice crystal number concentrations which commonly hit limiters and lack the variability and dependence on frozen water content seen in aircraft observations. Thompson and SAM1MOM have too little cirrus.

Title: Microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative responses of subtropical marine clouds to aerosol injections
Year: 2023
Abstract: Abstract. Ship tracks in subtropical marine low clouds are simulated and investigated using large-eddy simulations. Five variants of a shallow subtropical stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) are chosen to span a range of background aerosol concentrations and variations in free-tropospheric moisture. Idealized time-invariant meteorological forcings and approximately steady-state aerosol concentrations constitute the background conditions. We investigate processes controlling cloud microphysical, macrophysical, and radiative responses to aerosol injections. For the analysis, we use novel methods to decompose the liquid water path (LWP) adjustment into changes in cloud and boundary-layer properties and to decompose the cloud radiative effect (CRE) into contributions from cloud macro- and microphysics. The key results are that (a) the cloud-top entrainment rate increases in all cases, with stronger increases for thicker than thinner clouds; (b) the drying and warming induced by increased entrainment is offset to differing degrees by corresponding responses in surface fluxes, precipitation, and radiation; (c) MBL turbulence responds to changes caused by the aerosol perturbation, and this significantly affects cloud macrophysics; (d) across 2 d of simulation, clouds were brightened in all cases. In a pristine MBL, significant drizzle suppression by aerosol injections results not only in greater water retention but also in turbulence intensification, leading to a significant increase in cloud amount. In this case, Twomey brightening is strongly augmented by an increase in cloud thickness and cover. In addition, a reduction in the loss of aerosol through coalescence scavenging more than offsets the entrainment dilution. This interplay precludes estimation of the lifetime of the aerosol perturbation. The combined responses of cloud macro- and microphysics lead to 10–100 times more effective cloud brightening in these cases relative to those in the non-precipitating MBL cases. In moderate and polluted MBLs, entrainment enhancement makes the boundary layer drier, warmer, and more stratified, leading to a decrease in cloud thickness. This LWP response offsets the greatest fraction of the Twomey brightening in a moderately moist free troposphere. This finding differs from previous studies that found larger offsets in a drier free troposphere, and it results from a greater entrainment enhancement of initially thicker clouds, so the offsetting effects are weaker. The injected aerosol lifetime in cases with polluted MBLs is estimated to be 2–3 d, which is much longer than estimates of typical ship track lifetimes from satellite images.


Title: Response of water isotopes in precipitation to a collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model
Year: 2023
Abstract: 
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may have collapsed during the last interglacial period, between 132,000 and 116,000 years ago. The changes in topography resulting from WAIS collapse would be accompanied by significant changes in Antarctic surface climate, atmospheric circulation, and ocean conditions. Evidence of these changes may be recorded in water-isotope ratios in precipitation archived in the ice. We conduct high-resolution simulations with an isotope-enabled version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model over Antarctica, with boundary conditions provided by climate-model simulations with both present-day and lowered WAIS topography. The results show that while there is significant spatial variability, WAIS collapse would cause detectable isotopic changes at several locations where ice-core records have been obtained or could be obtained in the future. The most robust signals include elevated δ18O at SkyTrain Ice Rise in West Antarctica, and elevated deuterium excess at Hercules Dome in East Antarctica. A combination of records from multiple sites would provide constraints on the timing, rate, and magnitude of past WAIS collapse.

Title: Kilometer-scale global warming simulations and active sensors reveal changes in tropical deep convection
Year: 2023
Abstract: Changes in tropical deep convection with global warming are a leading source of uncertainty for future climate projections. A comparison of the responses of active sensor measurements of cloud ice to interannual variability and next-generation global storm-resolving model (also known as k -scale models) simulations to global warming shows similar changes for events with the highest column-integrated ice. The changes reveal that the ice loading decreases outside the most active convection but increases at a rate of several percent per Kelvin surface warming in the most active convection. Disentangling thermodynamic and vertical velocity changes shows that the ice signal is strongly modulated by structural changes of the vertical wind field towards an intensification of strong convective updrafts with warming, suggesting that changes in ice loading are strongly influenced by changes in convective velocities, as well as a path toward extracting information about convective velocities from observations.

Title: What Controls the Mesoscale Variations in Water Isotopic Composition Within Tropical Cyclones and Squall Lines? Cloud Resolving Model Simulations in Radiative‐Convective Equilibrium
Year: 2023
Abstract: Water isotopes are tracers of convective processes and are often used as proxies for past precipitation. These applications require a better understanding of the impact of convective processes on the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation. One way to advance this understanding is to analyze the isotopic mesoscale variations during organized convective systems such as tropical cyclones or squall lines. The goal of this study is to understand these isotopic mesoscale variations with particular attention to isotopic signals in near‐surface vapor and precipitation that may be present in observations and in paleoclimate proxies. With this aim, we run cloud resolving model simulations in radiative‐convective equilibrium in which rotation or wind shear is added, allowing us to simulate tropical cyclones or squall lines. The simulations capture the robust aspects of mesoscale isotopic variations in observed tropical cyclones and squall lines. We interpret these variations using a simple water budget model for the sub‐cloud layer of different parts of the domain. We find that rain evaporation and rain‐vapor diffusive exchanges are the main drivers of isotopic depletion within tropical cyclones and squall lines. Horizontal advection spreads isotopic anomalies, thus reshaping the mesoscale isotopic pattern. This study contributes to our understanding of mesoscale isotopic variability and provides physical arguments supporting the interpretation of paleoclimate isotopic archives in tropical regions in terms of past cyclonic activity.

Title: Sub-cloud rain evaporation in the North Atlantic winter trade winds derived by pairing isotopic data with a bin-resolved microphysical model
Year: 2023
Abstract: Abstract. Sub-cloud rain evaporation in the trade wind region significantly influences the boundary layer mass and energy budgets. Parameterizing it is, however, difficult due to the sparsity of well-resolved rain observations and the challenges of sampling short-lived marine cumulus clouds. In this study, sub-cloud rain evaporation is analyzed using a steady-state, one-dimensional model that simulates changes in drop sizes, relative humidity, and rain isotopic composition. The model is initialized with relative humidity, raindrop size distributions, and water vapor isotope ratios (e.g., δDv, δ18Ov) sampled by the NOAA P3 aircraft during the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean–Atmosphere Mesoscale Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC), which was part of the larger EUREC4A (ElUcidating the RolE of Clouds–Circulation Coupling in ClimAte) field program. The modeled surface precipitation isotope ratios closely match the observations from EUREC4A ground-based and ship-based platforms, lending credibility to our model. The model suggests that 63 % of the rain mass evaporates in the sub-cloud layer across 22 P3 cases. The vertical distribution of the evaporated rain flux is top heavy for a narrow (σ) raindrop size distribution (RSD) centered over a small geometric mean diameter (Dg) at the cloud base. A top-heavy profile has a higher rain-evaporated fraction (REF) and larger changes in the rain deuterium excess (d=δD-8×δ18O) between the cloud base and the surface than a bottom-heavy profile, which results from a wider RSD with larger Dg. The modeled REF and change in d are also more strongly influenced by cloud base Dg and σ rather than the concentration of raindrops. The model results are accurate as long as the variations in the relative humidity conditions are accounted for. Relative humidity alone, however, is a poor indicator of sub-cloud rain evaporation. Overall, our analysis indicates the intricate dependence of sub-cloud rain evaporation on both thermodynamic and microphysical processes in the trade wind region.


Title: Improving Stratocumulus Cloud Amounts in a 200‐m Resolution Multi‐Scale Modeling Framework Through Tuning of Its Interior Physics
Year: 2023
Abstract: High‐Resolution Multi‐scale Modeling Frameworks (HR)—global climate models that embed separate, convection‐resolving models with high enough resolution to resolve boundary layer eddies—have exciting potential for investigating low cloud feedback dynamics due to reduced parameterization and ability for multidecadal throughput on modern computing hardware. However low clouds in past HR have suffered a stubborn problem of over‐entrainment due to an uncontrolled source of mixing across the marine subtropical inversion manifesting as stratocumulus dim biases in present‐day climate, limiting their scientific utility. We report new results showing that this over‐entrainment can be partly offset by using hyperviscosity and cloud droplet sedimentation. Hyperviscosity damps small‐scale momentum fluctuations associated with the formulation of the momentum solver of the embedded large eddy simulation. By considering the sedimentation process adjacent to default one‐moment microphysics in HR, condensed phase particles can be removed from the entrainment zone, which further reduces entrainment efficiency. The result is an HR that can produce more low clouds with a higher liquid water path and a reduced stratocumulus dim bias. Associated improvements in the explicitly simulated sub‐cloud eddy spectrum are observed. We report these sensitivities in multi‐week tests and then explore their operational potential alongside microphysical retuning in decadal simulations at operational 1.5° exterior resolution. The result is a new HR having desired improvements in the baseline present‐day low cloud climatology, and a reduced global mean bias and root mean squared error of absorbed shortwave radiation. We suggest it should be promising for examining low cloud feedbacks with minimal approximation.

Title: Simulating Aerosol Lifecycle Impacts on the Subtropical Stratocumulus‐to‐Cumulus Transition Using Large‐Eddy Simulations
Year: 2022
Abstract: Observed stratocumulus to cumulus transitions (SCTs) and their sensitivity to aerosols are studied using a large‐eddy simulation (LES) model that simulates the aerosol lifecycle, including aerosol sources and sinks. To initialize, force, and evaluate the LES, we used a combination of reanalysis, satellite, and aircraft data from the 2015 Cloud System Evolution in the Trades field campaign over the Northeast Pacific. The simulations follow two Lagrangian trajectories from initially overcast stratocumulus (Sc) to the tropical shallow cumulus region near Hawaii. The first trajectory is characterized by an initially clean, well‐mixed Sc‐topped marine boundary layer (MBL), then continuous MBL deepening and precipitation onset followed by a clear SCT and a consistent reduction of aerosols that ultimately leads to an ultra‐clean layer in the upper MBL. The second trajectory is characterized by an initially polluted and decoupled MBL, weak precipitation, and a late SCT. Overall, the LES simulates the observed general MBL features. Sensitivity studies with different aerosol initial and boundary conditions reveal aerosol‐induced changes in the transition, and albedo changes are decomposed into the Twomey effect and adjustments of cloud liquid water path and cloud fraction. Impacts on precipitation play a key role in the sensitivity to aerosols: for the first case, runs with enhanced aerosols exhibit distinct changes in microphysics and macrophysics such as enhanced cloud droplet number concentration, reduced precipitation, and delayed SCT. Cloud adjustments are dominant in this case. For the second case, enhancing aerosols does not affect cloud macrophysical properties significantly, and the Twomey effect dominates.

Title: Hallett‐Mossop Rime Splintering Dims Cumulus Clouds Over the Southern Ocean: New Insight From Nudged Global Storm‐Resolving Simulations
Year: 2022
Abstract: In clouds containing both liquid and ice with temperatures between −3°C and −8°C, liquid droplets collide with large ice crystals, freeze, and shatter, producing a plethora of small ice splinters. This process, known as Hallett‐Mossop rime splintering, and other forms of secondary ice production, can cause clouds to reflect less sunlight and to have shorter lifetimes. We show its impact on Southern Ocean shallow cumuli using a novel suite of five global storm‐resolving simulations, which partition the Earth's atmosphere into 2–4 km wide columns. We evaluate simulated clouds and radiation over the Southern Ocean with aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES), and satellite observations from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Himawari. Simulations with large concentrations of ice crystals in boundary layer clouds, which agree better with SOCRATES observations, have reduced mixed‐phase cumulus cloud cover and weaker shortwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) that are less biased compared with CERES. Using a pair of simulations differing only in their treatment of Hallett‐Mossop rime splintering, we show that including this process increases ice crystal concentrations in cumulus clouds and weakens shortwave CREs over the Southern Ocean by 10 W m−2. We also demonstrate the key role that global storm‐resolving models can play in detangling the effects of clouds on Earth's climate across scales, making it possible to trace the impact of changes in individual cumulus cloud anvils (10 km2) on the radiative budget of the massive Southern Ocean basin (107 km2).

Title: Global System for Atmospheric Modeling: Model Description and Preliminary Results
Year: 2022
Abstract: The extension of a cloud‐resolving model, the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), to global domains is described. The resulting global model, gSAM, is formulated on a latitude‐longitude grid. It uses an anelastic dynamical core with a single reference profile (as in SAM), but its governing equations differ somewhat from other anelastic models. For quasihydrostatic flows, they are isomorphic to the primitive equations (PE) in pressure coordinates but with the globally uniform reference pressure playing the role of actual pressure. As a result, gSAM can exactly maintain steady zonally symmetric baroclinic flows that have been specified in pressure coordinates, produces accurate simulations when initialized or nudged with global reanalyses, and has a natural energy conservation equation despite the drawbacks of using the anelastic system to model global scales. gSAM employs a novel treatment of topography using a type of immersed boundary method, the Quasi‐Solid Body Method, where the instantaneous flow velocity is forced to stagnate in grid cells inside a prescribed terrain. The results of several standard tests designed to evaluate the accuracy of global models with and without topography as well as results from real Earth simulations are presented.

Title: The Vertical Profile of Radiative Cooling and Lapse Rate in a Warming Climate
Year: 2022
Abstract: 
The vertical profile of clear-sky radiative cooling places important constraints on the vertical structure of convection and associated clouds. Simple theory using the cooling-to-space approximation is presented to indicate that the cooling rate in the upper troposphere should increase with surface temperature. The theory predicts how the cooling rate depends on lapse rate in an atmosphere where relative humidity remains approximately a fixed function of temperature. Radiative cooling rate is insensitive to relative humidity because of cancellation between the emission and transmission of radiation by water vapor. This theory is tested with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations and radiative-convective equilibrium simulations. For climate simulations that produce an approximately moist adiabatic lapse rate, the radiative cooling profile becomes increasingly top-heavy with increasing surface temperature. If the temperature profile warms more slowly than a moist adiabatic profile in mid-troposphere, then the cooling rate in the upper troposphere is reduced and that in the lower troposphere is increased. This has important implications for convection, clouds and associated deep and shallow circulations.

Title: Tropical Cirrus in Global Storm‐Resolving Models: 1. Role of Deep Convection
Year: 2021
Abstract: Pervasive cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere and tropical tropopause layer (TTL) influence the climate by altering the top‐of‐atmosphere radiation balance and stratospheric water vapor budget. These cirrus are often associated with deep convection, which global climate models must parameterize and struggle to accurately simulate. By comparing high‐resolution global storm‐resolving models from the Dynamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non‐hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) intercomparison that explicitly simulate deep convection to satellite observations, we assess how well these models simulate deep convection, convectively generated cirrus, and deep convective injection of water into the TTL over representative tropical land and ocean regions. The DYAMOND models simulate deep convective precipitation, organization, and cloud structure fairly well over land and ocean regions, but with clear intermodel differences. All models produce frequent overshooting convection whose strongest updrafts humidify the TTL and are its main source of frozen water. Intermodel differences in cloud properties and convective injection exceed differences between land and ocean regions in each model. We argue that, with further improvements, global storm‐resolving models can better represent tropical cirrus and deep convection in present and future climates than coarser‐resolution climate models. To realize this potential, they must use available observations to perfect their ice microphysics and dynamical flow solvers.

Title: High Free‐Tropospheric Aitken‐Mode Aerosol Concentrations Buffer Cloud Droplet Concentrations in Large‐Eddy Simulations of Precipitating Stratocumulus
Year: 2021
Abstract: A new Aitken mode aerosol microphysics scheme is developed for a large eddy simulation model in order to better investigate cloud‐aerosol interactions in the marine boundary layer and to study the Aitken buffering hypothesis of McCoy et al. (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2020jd033529. This scheme extends the single‐mode two‐moment prognostic aerosol scheme of Berner et al. (2013), https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-12549-2013. Seven prognostic variables represent accumulation and Aitken log‐normal aerosol modes in air and droplets as well as 3 gas species. Scavenging of interstitial and other unactivated aerosol by cloud and rain drops are treated using the scheme described in Berner et al. (2013), https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-12549-2013. The scheme includes coagulation of unactivated aerosol and a simple chemistry model with gas phase H2SO4, SO2, and DMS as prognostic variables to capture basic influences of sulfur chemistry on the model aerosols. Nucleation of H2SO4 aerosol particles from gas‐phase H2SO4 is neglected. A deep, precipitating stratocumulus case (VAMOS Ocean Cloud Atmosphere Land Study RF06) is used to test the new scheme. The presence of the Aitken mode aerosol increases the cloud droplet concentration through activation of the larger Aitken particles and delays the creation of an ultraclean, strongly precipitating cumulus state. Scavenging of unactivated accumulation and Aitken particles by cloud and precipitation droplets accelerates the collapse. Increasing either the above‐inversion Aitken concentration or the surface Aitken flux increases the Aitken population in the boundary layer and prevents the transition to an ultraclean state.

Title: Load‐Balancing Intense Physics Calculations to Embed Regionalized High‐Resolution Cloud Resolving Models in the E3SM and CESM Climate Models
Year: 2021
Abstract: We design a new strategy to load‐balance high‐intensity sub‐grid atmospheric physics calculations restricted to a small fraction of a global climate simulation's domain. We show why the current parallel load balancing infrastructure of Community Earth System Model (CESM) and Energy Exascale Earth Model (E3SM) cannot efficiently handle this scenario at large core counts. As an example, we study an unusual configuration of the E3SM Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) that embeds a binary mixture of two separate cloud‐resolving model grid structures that is attractive for low cloud feedback studies. Less than a third of the planet uses high‐resolution (MMF‐HR; sub‐km horizontal grid spacing) relative to standard low‐resolution (MMF‐LR) cloud superparameterization elsewhere. To enable MMF runs with Multi‐Domain cloud resolving models (CRMs), our load balancing theory predicts the most efficient computational scale as a function of the high‐intensity work's relative overhead and its fractional coverage. The scheme successfully maximizes model throughput and minimizes model cost relative to precursor infrastructure, effectively by devoting the vast majority of the processor pool to operate on the few high‐intensity (and rate‐limiting) high‐resolution (HR) grid columns. Two examples prove the concept, showing that minor artifacts can be introduced near the HR/low‐resolution CRM grid transition boundary on idealized aquaplanets, but are minimal in operationally relevant real‐geography settings. As intended, within the high (low) resolution area, our Multi‐Domain CRM simulations exhibit cloud fraction and shortwave reflection convergent to standard baseline tests that use globally homogenous MMF‐LR and MMF‐HR. We suggest this approach can open up a range of creative multi‐resolution climate experiments without requiring unduly large allocations of computational resources.

Title: Diurnal differences in tropical maritime anvil cloud evolution
Year: 2021
Abstract: 
Satellite observations of tropical maritime convection indicate an afternoon maximum in anvil cloud fraction that cannot be explained by the diurnal cycle of deep convection peaking at night. We use idealized cloud-resolving model simulations of single anvil cloud evolution pathways, initialized at different times of the day, to show that tropical anvil clouds formed during the day are more widespread and longer lasting than those formed at night. This diurnal difference is caused by shortwave radiative heating, which lofts and spreads anvil clouds via a mesoscale circulation that is largely absent at night, when a different, longwave-driven circulation dominates. The nighttime circulation entrains dry environmental air that erodes cloud top and shortens anvil lifetime. Increased ice nucleation in more turbulent nighttime conditions supported by the longwave cloud top cooling and cloud base heating dipole cannot overcompensate for the effect of diurnal shortwave radiative heating. Radiative-convective equilibrium simulations with a realistic diurnal cycle of insolation confirm the crucial role of shortwave heating in lofting and sustaining anvil clouds. The shortwave-driven mesoscale ascent leads to daytime anvils with larger ice crystal size, number concentration, and water content at cloud top than their nighttime counterparts.

Title: Tropical Cirrus in Global Storm‐Resolving Models: 2. Cirrus Life Cycle and Top‐of‐Atmosphere Radiative Fluxes
Year: 2021
Abstract: Cirrus clouds of various thicknesses and radiative characteristics extend over much of the tropics, especially around deep convection. They are difficult to observe due to their high altitude and sometimes small optical depths. They are also difficult to simulate in conventional global climate models, which have coarse grid spacings and simplified parameterizations of deep convection and cirrus formation. We investigate the representation of tropical cirrus in global storm‐resolving models (GSRMs), which have higher spatial resolution and explicit convection and could more accurately represent cirrus cloud processes. This study uses GSRMs from the DYnamics of the Atmospheric general circulation Modeled On Non‐hydrostatic Domains (DYAMOND) project. The aggregate life cycle of tropical cirrus is analyzed using joint albedo and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) histograms to assess the fidelity of models in capturing the observed cirrus cloud populations over representative tropical ocean and land regions. The proportions of optically thick deep convection, anvils, and cirrus vary across models and are portrayed in the vertical distribution of cloud cover and top‐of‐atmosphere radiative fluxes. Model differences in cirrus populations, likely driven by subgrid processes such as ice microphysics, dominate over regional differences between convectively active tropical land and ocean locations.

Title: A modelling perspective on anvil evolution differences between day and night
Year: 2021
Abstract: <p>Geostationary satellite observations of tropical maritime convection indicate an afternoon maximum in anvil cloud fraction that cannot be explained by the diurnal cycle of deep convection peaking in the night. This implies that the daytime anvils must be more widespread and/or long lived compared with the anvils that are formed during the night.</p><p>We study the decay of anvil clouds in an idealized cloud resolving modelling setup in which a cloud is initialized in the middle of the model domain to identify what causes differences in the evolution depending on the time of the day in which the cloud is detrained from a deep convective core. We show that daytime anvils are both longer lived and more widespread. The main reason for their longevity is the heating due to absorption of shortwave radiation, which leads to a mesoscale ascent within the cloud, helping to loft and spread the cloud further than the nighttime anvils. The nighttime anvil cloud top is dominated by longwave radiative cooling, which drives a circulation that erodes the cloud top by entrainment of drier environmental air and leads to a cloud descent and shorter lifetime.&#160;</p><p>Additional simulations in radiative convective equilibrium setup with a realistic diurnal cycle of insolation confirm the crucial role of shortwave heating in increasing the daytime anvil cloud top and anvil longevity. In addition, the mesoscale ascent also modifies daytime anvil properties, leading to an increased ice water content, higher ice crystal number concentration and larger ice crystal radius near cloud top.</p>

Title: Simulating observed cloud transitions in the northeast Pacific during CSET
Year: 2021
Abstract: The goal of this study is to challenge a large eddy simulation model with a range of observations from a modern field campaign and to develop case studies useful to other modelers. The 2015 Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) field campaign provided a wealth of in situ and remote sensing observations of subtropical cloud transitions in the summertime Northeast Pacific. Two Lagrangian case studies based on these observations are used to validate the thermodynamic, radiative and microphysical properties of large eddy simulations (LES) of the stratocumulus to cumulus transition. The two cases contrast a relatively fast cloud transition in a clean, initially well-mixed boundary layer vs. a slower transition in an initially decoupled boundary layer with higher aerosol concentrations and stronger mean subsidence. For each case, simulations of two neighboring trajectories sample mesoscale variability and the coherence of the transition in adjacent air masses. In both cases, LES broadly reproduce satellite and aircraft observations of the transition. Simulations of the first case match observations more closely than for the second case, where simulations underestimate cloud cover early in the simulations and overestimate cloud top height later. For the first case, simulated cloud fraction and liquid water path increase if a larger cloud droplet number concentration is prescribed. In the second case, precipitation onset and inversion cloud breakup occurs earlier when the LES domain is chosen large enough to support strong mesoscale organization.

Title: Unusual Trapped Mountain Lee Waves with Deep Vertical Penetration and Significant Stratospheric Amplitude
Year: 2020
Abstract: 
 Simulations of the weather over the South Island of New Zealand on 28 July 2014 reveal unusual wave activity in the stratosphere. A series of short-wavelength perturbations resembling trapped lee waves were located downstream of the topography, but these waves were in the stratosphere, and their crests were oriented north–south, in contrast to both the northeast–southwest orientation of the spine of the Southern Alps and the crests of trapped waves present in the lower troposphere. Vertical cross sections through these waves show a nodal structure consistent with that of a higher-order trapped-wave mode. Eigenmode solutions to the vertical structure equation for two-dimensional, linear, Boussinesq waves were obtained for a horizontally homogeneous sounding representative of the 28 July case. These solutions include higher-order modes having large amplitude in the stratosphere that are supported by just the zonal wind component. Two of these higher-order modes correspond to trapped waves that develop in an idealized numerical simulation of the 28 July 2014 case. These higher-order modes are trapped by very strong westerly winds in the midstratosphere and are triggered by north–south-oriented features in the subrange-scale topography. In contrast, the stratospheric cross-mountain wind component is too weak to trap similar high-order modes with crest-parallel orientation.

Title: EUREC<sup>4</sup>A
Year: 2020
Abstract: Abstract. The science guiding the EUREC4A campaign and its measurements are presented. EUREC4A comprised roughly five weeks of measurements in the downstream winter trades of the North Atlantic – eastward and south-eastward of Barbados. Through its ability to characterize processes operating across a wide range of scales, EUREC4A marked a turning point in our ability to observationally study factors influencing clouds in the trades, how they will respond to warming, and their link to other components of the earth system, such as upper-ocean processes or, or the life-cycle of particulate matter. This characterization was made possible by thousands (2500) of sondes distributed to measure circulations on meso (200 km) and larger (500 km) scales, roughly four hundred hours of flight time by four heavily instrumented research aircraft, four global-ocean class research vessels, an advanced ground-based cloud observatory, a flotilla of autonomous or tethered measurement devices operating in the upper ocean (nearly 10000 profiles), lower atmosphere (continuous profiling), and along the air-sea interface, a network of water stable isotopologue measurements, complemented by special programmes of satellite remote sensing and modeling with a new generation of weather/climate models. In addition to providing an outline of the novel measurements and their composition into a unified and coordinated campaign, the six distinct scientific facets that EUREC4A explored – from Brazil Ring Current Eddies to turbulence induced clustering of cloud droplets and its influence on warm-rain formation – are presented along with an overview EUREC4A's outreach activities, environmental impact, and guidelines for scientific practice.


Title: How Well Do Large‐Eddy Simulations and Global Climate Models Represent Observed Boundary Layer Structures and Low Clouds Over the Summertime Southern Ocean?
Year: 2020
Abstract: Climate models struggle to accurately represent the highly reflective boundary layer clouds overlying the remote and stormy Southern Ocean. We use in situ aircraft observations from the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation and Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) to evaluate Southern Ocean clouds in a cloud‐resolving large‐eddy simulation (LES) and two coarse resolution global atmospheric models, the CESM Community Atmosphere Model (CAM6) and the GFDL Atmosphere Model (AM4), run in a nudged hindcast framework. We develop six case studies from SOCRATES data which span the range of observed cloud and boundary layer properties. For each case, the LES is run once forced purely using reanalysis data (fifth generation European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis, “ERA5 based”) and once strongly nudged to an aircraft profile(“Obs based”). The ERA5‐based LES can be compared with the global models, which are also nudged to reanalysis data and are better for simulating cumulus. The Obs‐based LES closely matches an observed cloud profile and is useful for microphysical comparisons and sensitivity tests and simulating multilayer stratiform clouds. We use two‐moment Morrison microphysics in the LES and find that it simulates too few frozen particles in clouds occurring within the Hallett‐Mossop temperature range. We tweak the Hallett‐Mossop parameterization so that it activates within boundary layer clouds, and we achieve better agreement between observed and simulated microphysics. The nudged global climate models (GCMs) simulate liquid‐dominated mixed‐phase clouds in the stratiform cases but excessively glaciate cumulus clouds. Both GCMs struggle to represent two‐layer clouds, and CAM6 has low droplet concentrations in all cases and underpredicts stratiform cloud‐driven turbulence.

Title: Rain Evaporation, Snow Melt, and Entrainment at the Heart of Water Vapor Isotopic Variations in the Tropical Troposphere, According to Large‐Eddy Simulations and a Two‐Column Model
Year: 2020
Abstract: We aim at developing a simple model as an interpretative framework for the water vapor isotopic variations in the tropical troposphere over the ocean. We use large‐eddy simulations of disorganized convection in radiative‐convective equilibrium to justify the underlying assumptions of this simple model, to constrain its input parameters and to evaluate its results. We also aim at interpreting the depletion of the water vapor isotopic composition in the lower and midtroposphere as precipitation increases, which is a salient feature in tropical oceanic observations. This feature constitutes a stringent test on the relevance of our interpretative framework. Previous studies, based on observations or on models with parameterized convection, have highlighted the roles of deep convective and mesoscale downdrafts, rain evaporation, rain‐vapor diffusive exchanges, and mixing processes. The interpretative framework that we develop, valid in case of disorganized convection, is a two‐column model representing the net ascent in clouds and the net descent in the environment. We show that the mechanisms for depleting the troposphere as the precipitation rate increases all stem from the higher tropospheric relative humidity. First, when the relative humidity is larger, less snow sublimates before melting and a smaller fraction of rain evaporates. Both effects lead to more depleted rain evaporation and eventually more depleted water vapor. This mechanism dominates in regimes of large‐scale ascent. Second, the entrainment of dry air into clouds reduces the vertical isotopic gradient and limits the depletion of tropospheric water vapor. This mechanism dominates in regimes of large‐scale descent.

Title: What Controls the Water Vapor Isotopic Composition Near the Surface of Tropical Oceans? Results From an Analytical Model Constrained by Large‐Eddy Simulations
Year: 2020
Abstract: The goal of this study is to understand the mechanisms controlling the isotopic composition of the water vapor near the surface of tropical oceans, at the scale of about a hundred kilometers and a month. In the tropics, it has long been observed that the isotopic compositions of rain and vapor near the surface are more depleted when the precipitation rate is high. This is called the “amount effect.” Previous studies, based on observations or models with parameterized convection, have highlighted the roles of deep convective and mesoscale downdrafts and rain evaporation. But the relative importance of these processes has never been quantified. We hypothesize that it can be quantified using an analytical model constrained by large‐eddy simulations. Results from large‐eddy simulations confirm that the classical amount effect can be simulated only if precipitation rate changes result from changes in the large‐scale circulation. We find that the main process depleting the water vapor compared to the equilibrium with the ocean is the fact that updrafts stem from areas where the water vapor is more enriched. The main process responsible for the amount effect is the fact that when the large‐scale ascent increases, isotopic vertical gradients are steeper, so that updrafts and downdrafts deplete the subcloud layer more efficiently.

Title: The Impact of Resolving Subkilometer Processes on Aerosol‐Cloud Interactions of Low‐Level Clouds in Global Model Simulations
Year: 2020
Abstract: Subkilometer processes are critical to the physics of aerosol‐cloud interaction (ACI) but have been dependent on parameterizations in global model simulations. We thus report the strength of ACI in the Ultra‐Parameterized Community Atmosphere Model (UPCAM), a multiscale climate model that uses coarse exterior resolution to embed explicit cloud‐resolving models with enough resolution (250 m horizontal, 20 m vertical) to quasi‐resolve subkilometer eddies. To investigate the impact on ACIs, UPCAM's simulations are compared to a coarser multiscale model with 4 km horizontal resolution. UPCAM produces cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) and cloud liquid water path (LWP) values that are higher than the coarser model but equally plausible compared to observations. Our analysis focuses on the Northern Hemisphere (20–50°N) oceans, where historical aerosol increases have been largest. We find similarities in the overall radiative forcing from ACIs in the two models, but this belies fundamental underlying differences. The radiative forcing from increases in LWP is weaker in UPCAM, whereas the forcing from increases in Nd is larger. Surprisingly, the weaker LWP increase is not due to a weaker increase in LWP in raining clouds, but a combination of weaker increase in LWP in nonraining clouds and a smaller fraction of raining clouds in UPCAM. The implication is that as global modeling moves toward finer than storm‐resolving grids, nuanced model validation of ACI statistics conditioned on the existence of precipitation and good observational constraints on the baseline probability of precipitation will become key for tighter constraints and better conceptual understanding.

Title: Nonequilibrium Fractionation During Ice Cloud Formation in iCAM5: Evaluating the Common Parameterization of Supersaturation as a Linear Function of Temperature
Year: 2019
Abstract: Supersaturation with respect to ice determines the strength of nonequilibrium fractionation during vapor deposition onto ice or snow and therefore influences the water isotopic composition of vapor and precipitation in cold environments. Historically, most general circulation models formed clouds through saturation adjustment and therefore prevented supersaturation. To match the observed isotopic content, especially the deuterium excess, of snow in polar regions, the saturation ratio with respect to ice (Si) was parameterized, usually by assuming a linear dependence of Si on temperature. The Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5) no longer applies saturation adjustment for the ice phase and thus allows ice supersaturation. Here, we adapt the isotope‐enabled version of CAM5 to compute nonequilibrium fractionation in ice and mixed‐phase clouds based on Si from the CAM5 microphysics and use it to evaluate the common parameterization of Si. Our results show a wide range of Si predicted by the CAM5 microphysics and reflected in the simulated deuterium excess of Antarctic precipitation; this is overly simplified by the linear parameterization. Nevertheless, a linear function, when properly tuned, can reproduce the average observed relationship between δD and deuterium excess reasonably well. However, only the model‐predicted Si can capture changes in microphysical conditions under different climate states that are not due to changes in temperature. Furthermore, parametric sensitivity tests show that with the model‐predicted Si, water isotopes are more closely tied to the model microphysics and can therefore constrain uncertain microphysical parameters.
