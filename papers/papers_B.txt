Title: Applying the ACE2 Emulator to SST Green's Functions for the E3SMv3 Global Atmosphere Model
Year: 2025
Abstract: Green's functions are a useful technique for interpreting atmospheric state responses to changes in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST). Here we train version 2 of the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE2) on reference historical SST simulations of the US Department of Energy's EAMv3 global atmosphere model. We compare how well the SST Green's functions generated by ACE2 match those of EAMv3, following the protocol of the Green's Function Model Intercomparison Project (GFMIP). The spatial patterns of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative response from the individual GFMIP SST patch simulations are similar for ACE and the EAMv3 reference. The derived sensitivity of global net TOA radiation sensitivity to SST patch location is qualitatively similar in ACE as in EAMv3, but there are statistically significant discrepancies for some SST patches, especially over the subtropical northeast Pacific. These discrepancies may reflect insufficient diversity in the SST patterns sampled over the course of the EAMv3 AMIP simulation used for training ACE. Both ACE and EAMv3 Green's functions reconstruct the historical record of the global annual-mean TOA radiative flux from a reference EAMv3 AMIP simulation reasonably well. Notably, under our configuration and compute resources, ACE achieves these results approximately 100 times faster in wall-clock time compared to EAMv3, highlighting its potential as a powerful and efficient tool for tackling other computationally intensive problems in climate science.

Title: Resolving Low Cloud Feedbacks Globally With E3SM High‐Res MMF: Agreement With LES but Stronger Shortwave Effects
Year: 2025
Abstract: This study investigates low cloud feedback in a warmer climate using global simulations from the High‐Resolution Multi‐scale Modeling Framework (HR‐MMF), which explicitly simulates small‐scale eddies globally. Two 5‐year simulations—one with present‐day sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a second with SSTs warmed uniformly by 4 K—reveal a positive global shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE = 0.3 W/ m2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{2}$ /K), comparable to estimates from CMIP models. As the climate warms, significant reductions in low cloud cover occur over stratocumulus regions. This study is the first attempt to compare HR‐MMF results with predictions from idealized large‐eddy simulations from the CGILS intercomparison. Despite different underlying assumptions, we find qualitative agreement in SWCRE and inversion height changes between HR‐MMF and CGILS predictions. This suggests reasonable credibility for the CGILS framework in predicting cloud responses under the out‐of‐sample conditions found in HR‐MMF. However, the HR‐MMF exhibits stronger SWCRE changes than predicted by CGILS. We explore potential causes for this discrepancy, examining variations in cloud‐controlling factors (CCFs) and cloud conditions. Our results show a fairly homogeneous SWCRE response, with little systematic variation tied to the variations in CCFs. This reveals a dominant role for SST forcing in modulating SWCRE.

Title: What Sets the Tropical Cold Point in GSRMs During Boreal Winter? Overshooting Convection Versus Cirrus Lofting
Year: 2025
Abstract: The cold point tropopause, the minimum temperature within the tropical upper troposphere‐lower stratosphere region (UTLS), significantly impacts Earth's climate by influencing the amount of water vapor entering the lower stratosphere. Understanding which mechanisms are most important in setting the cold point temperature and height may help us better predict how it will change in a future warmed climate. In this analysis we evaluate two mechanisms that may influence the cold point—cold point‐overshooting convection and the radiative lofting of thin cirrus near the cold point—during boreal winter by comparing 30‐day global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations from the winter phase of the DYAMOND initiative to satellite observations. GSRMs have explicit deep convection and sufficiently fine grid spacings to simulate convective overshoots and UTLS cirrus, making them promising tools for this purpose. We find that the GSRMs reproduce the observed distribution of cold point‐overshooting convection but do not simulate enough cirrus capable of radiative lofting near the cold point. Both the models and observations show a strong relationship between areas of frequent cold point overshoots and colder cold points, suggesting that cold point‐overshooting convection has a notable influence on the mean cold point. However, we find little evidence that the radiative lofting of cold point cirrus substantially influences the cold point. Cold point‐overshooting convection alone cannot explain all variations in the cold point across different GSRMs or regions; future studies using longer GSRM simulations that consider longer‐term UTLS processes are needed to fully understand what sets the cold point.

Title: The Precipitation Response to Warming and CO2 Increase: A Comparison of a Global Storm Resolving Model and CMIP6 Models
Year: 2024
Abstract: Global storm‐resolving models (GSRMs) that can explicitly resolve some of deep convection are now being integrated for climate timescales. GSRMs are able to simulate more realistic precipitation distributions relative to traditional Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models. In this study, we present results from two‐year‐long integrations of a GSRM developed at Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, eXperimental System for High‐resolution prediction on Earth‐to‐Local Domains (X‐SHiELD), for the response of precipitation to sea surface temperature warming and an isolated increase in CO2 and compare it to CMIP6 models. At leading order, X‐SHiELD's response is within the range of the CMIP6 models. However, a close examination of the precipitation distribution response reveals that X‐SHiELD has a different response at lower percentiles and the response of the extreme events are at the lower end of the range of CMIP6 models. A regional decomposition reveals that the difference is most pronounced for midlatitude land, where X‐SHiELD shows a lower increase at intermediate percentiles and drying at lower percentiles.

Title: Neural Network Parameterization of Subgrid‐Scale Physics From a Realistic Geography Global Storm‐Resolving Simulation
Year: 2024
Abstract: Parameterization of subgrid‐scale processes is a major source of uncertainty in global atmospheric model simulations. Global storm‐resolving simulations use a finer grid (less than 5 km) to reduce this uncertainty by explicitly resolving deep convection and details of orography. This study uses machine learning to replace the physical parameterizations of heating and moistening rates, but not wind tendencies, in a coarse‐grid (200 km) global atmosphere model, using training data obtained by spatially coarse‐graining a 40‐day realistic geography global storm‐resolving simulation. The training targets are the three‐dimensional fields of effective heating and moistening rates, including the effect of grid‐scale motions that are resolved but imperfectly simulated by the coarse model. A neural network is trained to predict the time‐dependent heating and moistening rates in each grid column using the coarse‐grained temperature, specific humidity, surface turbulent heat fluxes, cosine of solar zenith angle, land‐sea mask and surface geopotential of that grid column as inputs. The coefficient of determination R2 for offline prediction ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 at most vertical levels and latitudes. Online, we achieve stable 35‐day simulations, with metrics of skill such as the time‐mean pattern of near‐surface temperature and precipitation comparable or slightly better than a baseline simulation with conventional physical parameterizations. However, the structure of tropical circulation and relative humidity in the upper troposphere are unrealistic. Overall, this study shows potential for the replacement of human‐designed parameterizations with data‐driven ones in a realistic setting.

Title: ACE2: Accurately learning subseasonal to decadal atmospheric variability and forced responses
Year: 2024
Abstract: 
 Existing machine learning models of weather variability are not formulated to enable assessment of their response to varying external boundary conditions such as sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases. Here we present ACE2 (Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2) and its application to reproducing atmospheric variability over the past 80 years on timescales from days to decades. ACE2 is a 450M-parameter autoregressive machine learning emulator, operating with 6-hour temporal resolution, 1° horizontal resolution and eight atmospheric vertical layers. It exactly conserves global dry air mass and moisture and can be stepped forward stably for arbitrarily many steps with a throughput of about 1500 simulated years per wall clock day. ACE2 generates emergent phenomena such as tropical cyclones, the Madden Julian Oscillation, and sudden stratospheric warmings. Furthermore, it accurately reproduces the atmospheric response to El Niño variability and global trends of temperature over the past 80 years. However, its sensitivities to separately changing sea surface temperature and carbon dioxide are not entirely realistic.

Title: Application of the AI2 Climate Emulator to E3SMv2's Global Atmosphere Model, With a Focus on Precipitation Fidelity
Year: 2024
Abstract: Can the current successes of global machine learning‐based weather simulators be generalized beyond 2‐week forecasts to stable and accurate multiyear runs? The recently developed AI2 Climate Emulator (ACE) suggests this is feasible, based upon 10‐year simulations with a network trained on output from a physics‐based global atmosphere model using a grid spacing of approximately 110 km and forced by a repeating annual cycle of sea‐surface temperature. Here we show that ACE, without modification, can be trained to emulate another major atmospheric model, EAMv2, run at a comparable grid spacing for at least 10 years with similarly small climate biases—a prerequisite to wider applicability. With an analysis that combines multiple temporal, spatial, and frequency domain perspectives, we show that ACE faithfully represents the spatiotemporal structure of EAMv2 precipitation and related variables. Finally, we show that a pretrained ACE network is able to adapt to a new global climate model simulation data set with 10 fewer training steps than when starting from random initialization, all while still maintaining low levels of climate bias. Further analysis of these fine‐tuning experiments reveal ACE's intriguing ability to interpolate between distinct global climate models.

Title: Climate sensitivity and relative humidity changes in global storm-resolving model simulations of climate change
Year: 2024
Abstract: The climate simulation frontier of a global storm-resolving model (GSRM; or k-scale model because of its kilometer-scale horizontal resolution) is deployed for climate change simulations. The climate sensitivity, effective radiative forcing, and relative humidity changes are assessed in multiyear atmospheric GSRM simulations with perturbed sea-surface temperatures and/or carbon dioxide concentrations. Our comparisons to conventional climate model results can build confidence in the existing climate models or highlight important areas for additional research. This GSRM’s climate sensitivity is within the range of conventional climate models, although on the lower end as the result of neutral, rather than amplifying, shortwave feedbacks. Its radiative forcing from carbon dioxide is higher than conventional climate models, and this arises from a bias in climatological clouds and an explicitly simulated high-cloud adjustment. Last, the pattern and magnitude of relative humidity changes, simulated with greater fidelity via explicitly resolving convection, are notably similar to conventional climate models.

Title: Aitken Mode Aerosols Buffer Decoupled Mid‐Latitude Boundary Layer Clouds Against Precipitation Depletion
Year: 2024
Abstract: Aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions are a leading source of uncertainty in estimating climate sensitivity. Remote marine boundary layers where accumulation mode (∼100–400 nm diameter) aerosol concentrations are relatively low are very susceptible to aerosol changes. These regions also experience heightened Aitken mode aerosol (∼10–100 nm) concentrations associated with ocean biology. Aitken aerosols may significantly influence cloud properties and evolution by replenishing cloud condensation nuclei and droplet number lost through precipitation (i.e., Aitken buffering). We use a large‐eddy simulation with an Aitken‐mode enabled microphysics scheme to examine the role of Aitken buffering in a mid‐latitude decoupled boundary layer cloud regime observed on 15 July 2017 during the Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic flight campaign: cumulus rising into stratocumulus under elevated Aitken concentrations (∼100–200 mg−1). In situ measurements are used to constrain and evaluate this case study. Our simulation accurately captures observed aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions and reveals time‐evolving processes driving regime development and evolution. Aitken activation into the accumulation mode in the cumulus layer provides a reservoir for turbulence and convection to carry accumulation aerosols into the drizzling stratocumulus layer above. Further Aitken activation occurs aloft in the stratocumulus layer. Together, these activation events buffer this cloud regime against precipitation removal, reducing cloud break‐up and associated increases in heterogeneity. We examine cloud evolution sensitivity to initial aerosol conditions. With halved accumulation number, Aitken aerosols restore accumulation concentrations, maintain droplet number similar to original values, and prevent cloud break‐up. Without Aitken aerosols, precipitation‐driven cloud break‐up occurs rapidly. In this regime, Aitken buffering sustains brighter, more homogeneous clouds for longer.

Title: Global Precipitation Correction Across a Range of Climates Using CycleGAN
Year: 2024
Abstract: Accurate precipitation simulations for various climate scenarios are critical for understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change. This study employs a Cycle‐generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to improve global 3‐hr‐average precipitation fields predicted by a coarse grid (200 km) atmospheric model across a range of climates, morphing them to match their statistical properties with those of reference fine‐grid (25 km) simulations. We evaluate its performance on both the target climates and an independent ramped‐SST simulation. The translated precipitation fields remove most of the biases simulated by the coarse‐grid model in the mean precipitation climatology, the cumulative distribution function of 3‐hourly precipitation, and the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land. These results highlight the potential of CycleGAN as a powerful tool for bias correction in climate change simulations, paving the way for more reliable predictions of precipitation patterns across a wide range of climates.

Title: The Vertical Structure of Tropical Temperature Change in Global Storm‐Resolving Model Simulations of Climate Change
Year: 2024
Abstract: Global storm‐resolving model (GSRM) simulations (kilometer‐scale horizontal resolution) of the atmosphere can capture the interaction between the scales of deep cumulus convection and the large‐scale dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. Here, we assess the vertical structure of tropical temperature change in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's GSRM X‐SHiELD, perturbed by a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming and/or increased CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ concentration. The simulated warming from an SST increase is weakly amplified relative to the surface through the mid‐troposphere before increasing to a factor of about 2.5 in the upper troposphere. This combination of muted warming in the mid‐troposphere and amplified warming aloft is within the range of CMIP6 models at individual pressure levels but, taken together, is distinctive behavior. The response to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase with unchanged SST is an approximately vertically uniform warming, comparable to CMIP6 models, and is linearly additive with the SST‐induced warming in X‐SHiELD.

Title: Emulation of Cloud Microphysics in a Climate Model
Year: 2024
Abstract: We present a machine learning based emulator of a microphysics scheme for condensation and precipitation processes (Zhao‐Carr) used operationally in a global atmospheric forecast model (FV3GFS). Our tailored emulator architecture achieves high skill (≥94%) in predicting condensate and precipitation amounts and maintains low global‐average bias (≤4%) for 1 year of continuous simulation when replacing the Fortran scheme. The stability and success of this emulator stems from key design decisions. By separating the emulation of condensation and precipitation processes, we can better enforce physical priors such as mass conservation and locality of condensation, and the vertical dependence of precipitation falling downward, using specific network architectures. An activity classifier for condensation imitates the discrete‐continuous nature of the Fortran microphysics outputs (i.e., tendencies are identically zero where the scheme is inactive, and condensate is zero where clouds are fully evaporated). A temperature‐scaled conditional loss function ensures accurate condensate adjustments for a high dynamic range of cloud types (e.g., cold, low‐condensate cirrus clouds or warm, condensate‐rich clouds). Despite excellent overall performance, the emulator exhibits some deficiencies in the uppermost model levels, leading to biases in the stratosphere. The emulator also has short episodic skill dropouts in isolated grid columns and is computationally slower than the original Fortran scheme. Nonetheless, our challenges and strategies should be applicable to the emulation of other microphysical schemes. More broadly, our work demonstrates that with suitable physically motivated architectural choices, ML techniques can accurately emulate complex human‐designed parameterizations of fast physical processes central to weather and climate models.

Title: ACE2-SOM: Coupling an ML atmospheric emulator to a slab ocean and learning the sensitivity of climate to changed CO$_2$
Year: 2024
Abstract: While autoregressive machine-learning-based emulators have been trained to produce stable and accurate rollouts in the climate of the present-day and recent past, none so far have been trained to emulate the sensitivity of climate to substantial changes in CO$_2$ or other greenhouse gases. As an initial step we couple the Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 to a slab ocean model (hereafter ACE2-SOM) and train it on output from a collection of equilibrium-climate physics-based reference simulations with varying levels of CO$_2$. We test it in equilibrium and non-equilibrium climate scenarios with CO$_2$ concentrations seen and unseen in training. ACE2-SOM performs well in equilibrium-climate inference with both in-sample and out-of-sample CO$_2$ concentrations, accurately reproducing the emergent time-mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change with CO$_2$ doubling, tripling, or quadrupling. In addition, the vertical profile of atmospheric warming and change in extreme precipitation rates up to the 99.9999th percentile closely agree with the reference model. Non-equilibrium-climate inference is more challenging. With CO$_2$ increasing gradually at a rate of 2% year$^{-1}$, ACE2-SOM can accurately emulate the global annual mean trends of surface and lower-to-middle atmosphere fields but produces unphysical jumps in stratospheric fields. With an abrupt quadrupling of CO$_2$, ML-controlled fields transition unrealistically quickly to the 4xCO$_2$ regime. In doing so they violate global energy conservation and exhibit unphysical sensitivities of and surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes to instantaneous changes in CO$_2$. Future emulator development needed to address these issues should improve its generalizability to diverse climate change scenarios.

Title: Probabilistic Emulation of a Global Climate Model with Spherical DYffusion
Year: 2024
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning models are transforming global weather forecasting. It is an open question if this success can extend to climate modeling, where the complexity of the data and long inference rollouts pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first conditional generative model that produces accurate and physically consistent global climate ensemble simulations by emulating a coarse version of the United States' primary operational global forecast model, FV3GFS. Our model integrates the dynamics-informed diffusion framework (DYffusion) with the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture, enabling stable 100-year simulations at 6-hourly timesteps while maintaining low computational overhead compared to single-step deterministic baselines. The model achieves near gold-standard performance for climate model emulation, outperforming existing approaches and demonstrating promising ensemble skill. This work represents a significant advance towards efficient, data-driven climate simulations that can enhance our understanding of the climate system and inform adaptation strategies.

Title: Precipitation Downscaling with Spatiotemporal Video Diffusion
Year: 2023
Abstract: In climate science and meteorology, high-resolution local precipitation (rain and snowfall) predictions are limited by the computational costs of simulation-based methods. Statistical downscaling, or super-resolution, is a common workaround where a low-resolution prediction is improved using statistical approaches. Unlike traditional computer vision tasks, weather and climate applications require capturing the accurate conditional distribution of high-resolution given low-resolution patterns to assure reliable ensemble averages and unbiased estimates of extreme events, such as heavy rain. This work extends recent video diffusion models to precipitation super-resolution, employing a deterministic downscaler followed by a temporally-conditioned diffusion model to capture noise characteristics and high-frequency patterns. We test our approach on FV3GFS output, an established large-scale global atmosphere model, and compare it against six state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis, capturing CRPS, MSE, precipitation distributions, and qualitative aspects using California and the Himalayas as examples, establishes our method as a new standard for data-driven precipitation downscaling.

Title: ACE: A fast, skillful learned global atmospheric model for climate prediction
Year: 2023
Abstract: Existing ML-based atmospheric models are not suitable for climate prediction, which requires long-term stability and physical consistency. We present ACE (AI2 Climate Emulator), a 200M-parameter, autoregressive machine learning emulator of an existing comprehensive 100-km resolution global atmospheric model. The formulation of ACE allows evaluation of physical laws such as the conservation of mass and moisture. The emulator is stable for 100 years, nearly conserves column moisture without explicit constraints and faithfully reproduces the reference model's climate, outperforming a challenging baseline on over 90% of tracked variables. ACE requires nearly 100x less wall clock time and is 100x more energy efficient than the reference model using typically available resources. Without fine-tuning, ACE can stably generalize to a previously unseen historical sea surface temperature dataset.

Title: Improving the Reliability of ML‐Corrected Climate Models With Novelty Detection
Year: 2023
Abstract: Using machine learning (ML) for the online correction of coarse‐resolution atmospheric models has proven effective in reducing biases in near‐surface temperature and precipitation rate. However, ML corrections often introduce new biases in the upper atmosphere and causes inconsistent model performance across different random seeds. Furthermore, they produce profiles that are outside the distribution of samples used in training, which can interfere with the baseline physics of the atmospheric model and reduce model reliability. This study introduces the use of a novelty detector to mask ML corrections when the atmospheric state is deemed out‐of‐sample. The novelty detector is trained on profiles of temperature and specific humidity in a semi‐supervised fashion using samples from the coarsened reference fine‐resolution simulation. The novelty detector responds to particularly biased simulations relative to the reference simulation by categorizing more columns as out‐of‐sample. Without novelty detection, corrective ML occasionally causes undesirably large climate biases. When coupled to a running year‐long coarse‐grid simulation, novelty detection deems about 21% of columns to be novelties. This identification reduces the spread in the root‐mean‐square error (RMSE) of time‐mean spatial patterns of surface temperature and precipitation rate across a random seed ensemble. In particular, the random seed with the worst RMSE is improved by up to 60% (depending on the variable) while the best seed maintains its low RMSE. By reducing the variance in quality of ML‐corrected climate models, novelty detection offers reliability without compromising prediction quality in atmospheric models.

Title: Cloud System Evolution in the Trades-CSET: Following the Evolution of Boundary Layer Cloud Systems with the NSF/NCAR GV.
Year: 2019
Abstract: The Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) study was designed to describe and explain the evolution of the boundary layer aerosol, cloud, and thermodynamic structures along trajectories within the north-Pacific trade-winds. The study centered on 7 round-trips of the NSF NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) between Sacramento, CA and Kona, Hawaii between 1 July and 15 August 2015. The CSET observing strategy was to sample aerosol, cloud, and boundary layer properties upwind from the transition zone over the North Pacific and to resample these areas two days later. GFS forecast trajectories were used to plan the outbound flight to Hawaii with updated forecast trajectories setting the return flight plan two days later. Two key elements of the CSET observing system were the newly developed HIAPER Cloud Radar (HCR) and the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). Together they provided unprecedented characterizations of aerosol, cloud and precipitation structures that were combined with in situ measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and turbulence properties. The cloud systems sampled included solid stratocumulus infused with smoke from Canadian wildfires, mesoscale cloud-precipitation complexes, and patches of shallow cumuli in very clean environments. Ultra-clean layers observed frequently near the top of the boundary layer were often associated with shallow, optically thin, layered veil clouds. The extensive aerosol, cloud, drizzle and boundary layer sampling made over open areas of the Northeast Pacific along 2-day trajectories during CSET is unprecedented and will enable modeling studies of boundary layer cloud system evolution and the role of different processes in that evolution.

Title: Single‐Column Emulation of Reanalysis of the Northeast Pacific Marine Boundary Layer
Year: 2019
Abstract: An artificial neural network is trained to reproduce thermodynamic tendencies and boundary layer properties from European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation high resolution realization reanalysis data over the summertime northeast Pacific stratocumulus to trade cumulus transition region. The network is trained prognostically using 7‐day forecasts rather than using diagnosed instantaneous tendencies alone. The resulting model, Machine‐Assisted Reanalysis Boundary Layer Emulation, skillfully reproduces the boundary layer structure and cloud properties of the reanalysis data in 7‐day single‐column prognostic simulations over withheld testing periods. Radiative heating profiles are well simulated, and the mean climatology and variability of the stratocumulus to cumulus transition are accurately reproduced. Machine‐Assisted Reanalysis Boundary Layer Emulation more closely tracks the reanalysis than does a comparable configuration of the underlying forecast model.
